# FormSwimAnalyzer

This app attempts to delve even deeper into the rich data that Form swimming goggles provide. The aim is to present the data in a fashion that is enables easy analysis of stroke and performance.

Written in .NET Maui Blazor, I created this app with the main intention of being used on Windows desktop, but it has the ability to be easily expanded to mobile devices.

## Directions for use

It's very straight forward to use this app, but the CSV data needs some sanitisation before it can be used.
Before uploading, ensure that the meta data fields in a typical form export have been removed, ensuring the header of the data are first row.
A potential improvement could be do this santisation programmatically.
